            Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Rajendra Mandliya</strong>, a passionate Full-Stack
            Developer with <strong>2+ years</strong> of experience in building
            scalable and efficient web applications. I specialize in{" "}
            <strong>React, Node.js, and FastAPI</strong>, with expertise in API
            development, deployment, and performance optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong foundation in{" "}
            <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>, solving 500+
            problems on LeetCode, which helps me write optimized and efficient
            code. Additionally, I have experience leading a team of 5
            developers, working on both service-based and product-based
            projects.
          </p>
